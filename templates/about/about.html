								Dagkot is a Bisayan term which means to ignite or light up with fire. A popular ritual amongst Filipinos is to go to church, 
								light up one or more candles, then offer a prayer. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Visayan region, this ritual is commonly known as "dagkot", which means "to light a candle and offer a prayer." 
								Almost all churches in the Philippines have a "dagkotanan", a place where people light up candles and pray for their intentions. 
							</p>	
							<p>	
							People usually do the act of dagkot when celebrating birthdays, fiestas, thanks giving, or to commemorate loved ones that passed away. 
							They believe that lighting a candle and offering a prayer would bring good luck and more blessings. 
							<p>
							Everyday, lots of people want to go to church to dagkot, but are unable to do so because of their busy schedules or other personal reasons. 
							</p>
							<p>
							This Web application, Virtual Dagkot, allows them to dagkot from the comfort of their home, or even from their offices.
